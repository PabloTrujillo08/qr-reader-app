# QR Reader Angular Project

This project is an Angular (v16) application that reads QR codes using the qr-scanner library. It displays the video feed from the camera and reads QR codes in real-time, displaying the result immediately after detection. 


## Install Dependencies

### Install qr-scanner

First, we need to install the qr-scanner library. This library provides a straightforward way to implement QR code scanning functionality in a web application. 
To install it, run the following command in your terminal:

"npm install qr-scanner"


### Install TypeScript Types for qr-scanner

To make the qr-scanner library work seamlessly with TypeScript, we also need to install the TypeScript type definitions for qr-scanner. This will allow TypeScript to understand the types and structures used in the qr-scanner library, providing better autocomplete and type-checking features in our development environment. 
To install it, run the following command in your terminal:

"npm install --save-dev @types/qr-scanner"
